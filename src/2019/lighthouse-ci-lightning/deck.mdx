Hey everyone, I'm Patrick. I used to work on the Chrome team and have spent signficant portion of my life pushing the web.

Today we're gonna be talking about Lighthouse CI and how it can help you and your site "keep it 100"

# ‚ö° Agenda

- Lighthouse, the tl;dr
- The CI Dilemma
- The Setup
- The Extras
- Q & A

```notes
Well here's our lightning fast agenda for tonight...


Before we start,

how many have heard of Lighthouse?
how many use it regularly?
how many know what the acronym CI means in a development context?

OK, cool

and now to Lighthouse
```

# Lighthouse, the tl;dr

```notes
anyone familiar with Lighthouse wanna take a stab at saying what it is?
```

---


<img style={{maxWidth: '50vw', maxHeight: '50vh'}} src={require('file-loader!./lighthouse.svg')} />

lighthouse | \Ààlƒ´t-ÀåhauÃás (n):

a ~~tower or other structure~~ tool containing a beacon light to warn or guide ~~ships at sea~~ developers.

```notes
[We'll keep this short since so many of you are familiar]

Lighthouse is a web auditing tool that helps you deliver a great web experience.

[skip to next if familiar]

The web is a complicated place in 2019 with way, way too much for any one person to remember and keep track of in addition to your feature requirements. Lighthouse helps you offload that to focus on what's important and have an easy checklist when you're ready to make your site better.
```

<img style={{maxWidth: '90vw', maxHeight: '90vh'}} src={require('file-loader!./report.png')} />

```notes
And it gives you a report like this, summary of the site's quality across the key categories with a score, and lets you drill down into the details in the rest of the report.

To give you an idea of the types of checks, everything from performance metrics, images that are too large and files that aren't minified to missing form labels, password inputs without paste and loading offline

You can get it from Chrome DevTools, node CLI, PageSpeed Insights, Chrome Extension, which is awesome!

BUT, that's all manual, we're developers and that's just not gonna cut it.

# The CI Dilemma

```notes
anyone familiar with CI wanna take a stab at saying what it is?

Yeah exactly, continuous integration is about automatically testing each of your changes before they're merged so you can rely on the correctness of trunk or master branch.

In CI, manual just won't fly, CI gated on manual tests by a developer is CI that always passes :)

<Row>

<Column>
<img style={{marginRight: '2vw', width: '45vw', height: '90vh', objectFit: 'contain'}} src={require('file-loader!./lhci-server-4.png')} />

```notes
With Lighthouse CI, it'll run Lighthouse on every commit, get status checks right in GitHub for audit failures, and a fancy diffing UI on your very own Lighthouse CI server.

If you're eager and want to poke around the docs already, bit.ly/lhci takes you straight to the good stuff.

But let's jump into how to set it up.
```

export default SectionInverted

# The Setup

---


<Row>

<Column>

#### .travis.yml

```yaml
language: node_js
addons:
  chrome: stable
before_install:
  - npm install -g @lhci/cli@0.3.x
script:
  - npm run build
after_success:
  - lhci autorun --upload.target=temporary-public-storage
```

</Column>

<Column style={{display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center', alignItems: 'center'}}>
<img style={{marginLeft: '2vw', width: '40vw', height: '40vh', objectFit: 'contain'}} src={require('file-loader!./travis.png')} />
</Column>
</Row>

```notes
You can throw LHCI onto one of your projects with just 9 lines even if you don't have any continuous integration process already setup. Travis is a continuous integration provider that's free for open source projects, Circle CI is also free for private projects. Lighthouse CI works with just about any CI provider and there are example setup configs for half a dozen providers, but we'll take a look at this travis one since they're all so similar.

Let's look at what each of these lines do...

- Give us a node_js environment
- Give us Chrome environment
- Installs lighthouse CI, if anyone can say "Lighthouse CI CLI" 3 times fast you get an exclusive Chrome DevTools sticker :)
- Builds our static site
- Runs lighthouse CI and uploads the results to a public URL that's accessible to everyone

So now we've got Lighthouse running on every commit and a link to the report in our build logs, but that's not what you came here for, we want those snazzy screenshots and our bot to keep it 100!

## Assertions

**lighthouserc.json**:

<div style={{textAlign: 'left', maxWidth: '90vw', overflowX: 'scroll'}}>
<Highlighter language="json">
{`{
  "ci": {
    "assert": {
      "preset": "lighthouse:recommended",
      "assertions": {
        "first-contentful-paint": ["error", {"maxNumericValue": 2000}],
        "interactive": ["error", {"maxNumericValue": 5000}],
        "resource-summary:scripts:size": ["error", {"maxNumericValue": 100000}]
      }
    }
  }
}`}
</Highlighter>
</div>


```notes
We can tell Lighthouse CI to fail on a particular outcome based on our thresholds. Just create a lighthouserc config file with some thresholds and you're good to go.
```

---

## GitHub Status checks

#### https://github.com/apps/lighthouse-ci

<img style={{width: '80vw', height: '70vh', objectFit: 'contain'}} src={require('file-loader!./github-app.png')} />

```notes
we want more than some build log output though, let's get Github involved! Open up the Lighthouse CI github app by going to that URL or clicking the link in the getting started section of Lighthouse CI docs, and add it to you repos. It's going to give you a LHCI_GITHUB_APP_TOKEN that you put in your CI provider's environment variables and BOOM you've got these nice little checkmarks on your PRs with links to the report right from github.
```

---

## Lighthouse CI Server


<Row>

<Column>
<img style={{marginRight: '2vw', width: '45vw', height: '90vh', objectFit: 'contain'}} src={require('file-loader!./lhci-server-3.png')} />
</Column>

<Column>
<img style={{width: '45vw', height: '90vh', objectFit: 'contain'}} src={require('file-loader!./lhci-server-4.png')} />
</Column>

</Row>

### bit.ly/lhci - docs/recipes/heroku-server/README.md

<div style={{maxWidth: '80vw', overflowX: 'scroll', textAlign: 'left'}}>

<Highlighter language="bash">
{`# Create a directory and repo for your heroku project
