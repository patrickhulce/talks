# What's a PWA?

---

A **progressive web app** is

a **web application**

that leverages **modern browser technology**

to act and **feel like a native app**,

but **with the reach of the web**.

---

Don't think of a PWA as a new thing you have to write from scratch.

## Progressive web apps are about making your web experience awesome.

---

## A PWA...

- Works offline and on "Lie-Fi"
- Push notifications and background sync
- Added to desktop/homescreen
- Loads without traditional browser UI
- Treated as a separate application by the OS

# Service Worker

- Works offline and on "Lie-Fi"
- Push notifications and background sync

<Column style={{opacity: 0.5}}>

- Added to desktop/homescreen
- Loads without traditional browser UI
- Treated as a separate application by the OS

</Column>

A **service worker** is

a **special type of web worker**

that can **control network traffic**

and **run in the background**.

---

## Implications

1. Site must be on HTTPS

2. Service Worker becomes THE authority on caching

3. You can do some amazing things

```notes
1. Can't have insecure scripts taking your website hostage
2. That means if you say "here's this resource it's fresh", browser will believe you. Don't shoot yourself in the foot! More on this later...
3. Controlling the entire network means you can do some crazy and amazing things, offline generate your own HTML documents, move SSR to the service worker, sky is the limit!
Running in the background without a page means awesome stuff like push notifications and background sync!
```

---

## Register It

#### page.js

```js
window.addEventListener('load', async () => {
  await navigator.serviceWorker.register('/service-worker.js')
})
```

#### service-worker.js

```js
self.addEventListener('install', event => {
  // A new service worker is being installed!
  console.log('Installing!', event)
})

self.addEventListener('activate', event => {
  // The service worker is ready to handle our network traffic!
  console.log('Activating!', event)
})

self.addEventListener('fetch', event => {
  // The page is fetching something!
  console.log('Fetching!', event)
})
```

---

## Cache Some Cats

#### service-worker.js

```js
self.addEventListener('install', event => {
  // Put a resource into the cache
  const cachePromise = caches.open('static-v1').then(cache => cache.add('/cat.png'))
  // Delay installation complete until we cache it!
  event.waitUntil(cachePromise)
})

self.addEventListener('fetch', event => {
  const url = new URL(event.request.url)

  // Check if we're requesting our cat image
  if (url.origin === location.origin && url.pathname === '/cat.png') {
    // If we are, let's serve that kitten from the cache!
    event.respondWith(caches.match('/cat.png'))
  }
})
```

---

export default ({children}) => <div style={{fontSize: '60%'}}>{children}</div>

## Simplest Real Service Worker

```js
const version = '1.0.0'
const cacheName = `pwa-${version}`

self.addEventListener('install', e => {
  e.waitUntil(
    caches.open(cacheName).then(cache => {
      return (
        cache
          // Add all of our assets to the cache
          .addAll([
            `/`,
            `/index.html`,
            `/styles/main.css`,
            `/scripts/main.min.js`,
            `/scripts/vendor.min.js`,
            `/images/image-1.jpg`,
            `/images/image-2.jpg`,
            `/images/image-3.jpg`,
          ])
          // Make this service worker active immediately
          .then(() => self.skipWaiting())
      )
    }),
  )
})

self.addEventListener('activate', event => {
  event.waitUntil(
    caches.keys().then(allCacheNames => {
      // Clear out all the old cache data we won't use anymore
      return Promise.all(
        allCacheNames.filter(name => name !== cacheName).map(name => caches.delete(name)),
      )
    }),
  )
})

self.addEventListener('fetch', event => {
  event.respondWith(
    caches
      .open(cacheName)
      // Try to find the request in the cache
      .then(cache => cache.match(event.request, {ignoreSearch: true}))
      // Return the cache response or fetch over the network
      .then(response => response || fetch(event.request)),
  )
})
```

# WARNING

## Writing service worker logic is **HARD**.

## The stakes are a lot higher now!

## A mistake in your service worker could mean freezing your site in time forever!

---

## Solution: Don't Write It Yourself!

<img style={{width: '30vw', margin: '5vh 0'}} src={require('file-loader!./workbox.svg')} />

```bash
$ npm install -g workbox-cli
$ workbox wizard
    ? What is the root of your web app (i.e. which directory do you deploy)? src/
    ? Which file types would you like to precache? ico, png, js, css, json
    ? Where would you like your service worker file to be saved? src/sw.js
    ? Where would you like to save these configuration options? workbox-config.js
$ workbox generateSW workbox-config.js
    The service worker was written to src/sw.js
    17 files will be precached, totalling 109 kB.
```

---

## Test It

```bash
$ npm install -g lighthouse
$ lighthouse https://my-pwa.com --view
```

<img style={{maxHeight: '60vh'}} src={require('file-loader!./pwa-lh.png')} />

# Appyness

### Web App Manifest

---

# Web App Manifest

<Column style={{opacity: 0.5}}>

- Works offline and on "Lie-Fi"
- Push notifications and background sync

</Column>

- Added to desktop/homescreen
- Loads without traditional browser UI
- Treated as a separate application by the OS

---

A **web app manifest** is

a **special JSON file**

that **declares your site a PWA**

and controls **how your app looks** when installed.

---

## my-app.webmanifest

```JSON
{
  "name": "The Progressive Web App",
  "short_name": "PWA",
  "icons": [{"src": "/icon.png", "type": "image/png", "sizes": "192x192"}],
  "start_url": "/index.html?homescreen=1",
  "scope": "/",
  "display": "standalone",
  "background_color": "#2196F3",
  "theme_color": "#2196F3"
}
```

---

## Link It Up

```html
...
<head>
  <title>The Progressive Web App</title>
  <!-- way too much stuff Lighthouse complains about :) -->
  <!-- ... -->
  <link rel="manifest" href="/my-app.webmanifest" />
</head>
...
```

---

## Test It

```bash
$ npm install -g lighthouse
$ lighthouse https://my-pwa.com --view
```

<img style={{maxHeight: '60vh'}} src={require('file-loader!./pwa-lh.png')} />

---

# Your Reward

<img style={{maxWidth: '25vw'}} src={require('file-loader!./add-to-homescreen.jpg')} />
<img style={{maxWidth: '25vw'}} src={require('file-loader!./add-to-homescreen.png')} />
<img style={{maxWidth: '25vw', maxHeight: '25vh'}} src={require('file-loader!./add-to-homescreen-2.png')} />

# The Platform Story

<Column style={{fontSize: '150%'}}>

|         | Mobile     | Windows    | Mac        |
| ------- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| Chrome  | Full ✅    | Full ✅    | Full\* ✅  |
| Safari  | Full ✅    | N/A        | Partial 🙂 |
| Firefox | Partial 🙂 | Partial 🙂 | Partial 🙂 |
| Edge    | N/A        | Full ✅    | N/A        |

</Column>

#### Full = Service Worker and Manifests supported

#### Partial = Service worker supported but Manifests supported

#### \* = Chrome on Desktop Mac Manifest support is behind a flag, will make its way to stable soon

## PWA

<Span theme={chromeTheme}>
  Uses service workers and manifests to bring native-like capabilities to a website.
</Span>

<Row style={{fontSize: '75%'}}>

<Column style={{width: '50vw'}}>

### Pros

- Entirely web ergonomics
- Works everywhere
- No install step for the user

</Column>

<Column>

### Cons

- Won't cover 100% of native use cases
- Desktop and iOS experience fairly lacking

</Column>

</Row>

---

## Electron

<Span theme={chromeTheme}>
  Uses modified Chromium and Node.js bundle to run your application. If developer-facing, consider
  using <a href="https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/carlo">carlo</a> instead.
</Span>

<Row style={{fontSize: '75%'}}>

<Column style={{width: '50vw'}}>

### Pros

- Mostly web ergonomics

</Column>

<Column>

### Cons

- Desktop only
- Security concerns

</Column>

</Row>

---

## Cordova / Ionic / PhoneGap

</Column>

<Column>

### Cons

- Mobile only
- Need XCode/Android Studio and native plugins

</Column>

---

## React Native

<Span theme={chromeTheme}>
  Not really a web technology. Lets you use JavaScript to write native mobile and windows apps.
</Span>

<Row style={{fontSize: '75%'}}>

<Column style={{width: '50vw'}}>

### Pros

- Uses real native UI components
- Feature in App Store/Play Store

</Column>

<Column>

### Cons

- App is platform-specific
- Not really the web, cannot reuse as a website

</Column>

</Row>

# Recap

```notes
1. PWAs are just bridging the functionality gap between the web and native
2. Service worker and web app manifest are what you use to get there
3. Use workbox and Lighthouse to automate as much as possible
```
