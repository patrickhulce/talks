# Terminology

---

## Chrome vs. Chromium

**Chromium** = **the open-source browser**.

**Chrome** = **Chromium augmented and distributed by Google**.

Chrome-specific features include automatic updates and proprietary codecs like H.264.

Chromium is also used and embedded by Edge, Opera, Brave, Samsung Internet, Smart TVs, etc.

```notes
Chrome is augmented with proprietary codecs like MP3, H.264, etc whose licenses make open source distribution difficult.
Autoupdates
```

## Browser

Complete application that allows users to access and interact with the web.

Examples: Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari

---

## Rendering/layout engine

Core component of a browser that renders HTML and CSS into interactive UI elements.

Examples: WebKit (Safari), Blink (Chrome), Gecko (Firefox), Trident (IE)

---

## JavaScript engine

Core component of a browser that executes JavaScript code, access to the DOM is provided in conjuction with the rendering engine.

Examples: V8 (Chrome), SpiderMonkey (Firefox), Chakra (IE)

---

## Process

An operating system construct that provides an isolated execution context for a program.

---

## Thread

An operating system construct that provides an independently schedulable work queue. A process can have multiple threads.

# Browsers: A History

---

> 1994

> Netscape Navigator

<img style={{maxHeight: '30vh'}} src={require('file-loader!./netscape.png')} />

```notes
The year is 1994, JavaScript was invented in 10 days, and there's one obvious browser choice Netscape. CSS isn't even a thing yet.
```

---

> 1997

> Internet Explorer 4

<img style={{maxHeight: '30vh'}} src={require('file-loader!./ie4.jpg')} />

```notes
The year is 1997, IE4 just changed the game. It's free and installed by default on all Windows machines. Game over.
```

---

> 2006

> Internet Explorer 7

<img style={{maxHeight: '30vh'}} src={require('file-loader!./ie7.webp')} />

```notes
The year is 2006, JT had only just brought sexy back, and IE7 is hot off the presses.
Tabs are finally a thing! But browsers have a few problems, one bad popup can crash all your tabs.
Flash plugins are all over the place enabling remote code execution attacks across the web.
JavaScript is really, *really* slow.
```

---

> 2006

> Firefox 2

<img style={{maxHeight: '30vh'}} src={require('file-loader!./firefox2.webp')} />

```notes
It's not all bad, Firefox is fighting the good fight with an open source browser.
Firefox 2 has just been released and their JavaScript performance is nearly 6x faster
```

---

# DOS Anyone's Browser in 10 Characters

```js
while (1);
```

---

> 2008

> Chrome

<img style={{maxHeight: '30vh'}} src={require('file-loader!./chrome3.png')} />

```notes
2008, Chrome breaks onto the scene advertising speed, security, stability, and simplicity. Also open source like firefox
V8 is 56x faster executing javascript than IE7's engine.
One bad tab won't take down the whole browser.
How'd they do it?
```

# Chromium Architecture

---

Chrome uses a **multi-process architecture**

to isolate sites and tabs

for **improved security**, **stability**, and **speed**.

```notes
Today, this has become a defacto standard for building a browser, but was fairly revolutionary at the time.

What does this mean in practice?
```

---

<img
  style={{maxHeight: '90vh', maxWidth: '90vw'}}
  src={require('file-loader!./chrome-helper-screenshot.png')}
/>

```notes
As a user you've probably seen it like this, this is your CPU on multi-process architecture
```

---

<img
  style={{height: '80vh', width: '80vw', objectFit: 'contain'}}
  src={require('file-loader!./browser-arch.png')}
/>

```notes
This is what all of those Chrome helpers are doing, some are responsible for the network requests, some are responsible filesystem interaction, etc


By separating each of these concerns, Chrome can sandbox processes that don't deal with the filesystem to make sure they *can't* access the filesystem, etc.

```

  src={require('file-loader!./renderer-process.png')}
/>

_Figure from [Inside look at modern web browser](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2018/09/inside-browser-part1), Mariko Kosaka_

```notes
Typically each tab gets its own process and more recently even different origins within the same tab get their own process, more on this later.
```

---

<img
  style={{height: '80vh', width: '80vw', objectFit: 'contain'}}
  src={require('file-loader!./main-thread.png')}
/>

```notes
There's a lot going inside all of this, and we're about to walk through some examples in a second.

But the last important high level piece you need to know is that each renderer process has 1 "main thread".

This is where HTML is parsed, input is processed, javascript is executed, style and layout are computed, etc.

Because there's only one main thread that handles all of these things, that means none of them can happen at the same time.

No two JavaScript functions are being executed at once, we can't be running a click handler and computing style at the same time, etc.

If you've ever looked at the "Performance" tab in DevTools, that's what this is showing, what is happening on the main thread.
