Hey everyone, I'm Patrick. I used to work on the Chrome team and have spent signficant portion of my life pushing the web.

Today we're gonna be talking about Browser integration testing and how it can help automatically check that your site working great

web testing 101, i.e. how can you automatically catch bugs in your website or webapp before your users do

> Write tests. Not too many. Mostly integration.

Kent C. Dodds

```notes
This is a quote by Kent C Dodds, which really spoke to my soul the first time I heard it, and we'll cover the series of libraries it inspired a little later in this talk, but the gist here is that you want tests that give you confidence your code is correct when they pass, and are a strong signal of user-facing failures when they don't.

So what is an integration test anyway?

```

---

## Common Automated Tests

- compilation (typescript/babel/webpack)
- linters (eslint/tslint)
- unit tests (enzyme)

## Not as Common as They Should Be‚Ñ¢ :)

- integration tests (puppeteer/protractor/selenium)
- performance tests (Chrome Lighthouse üòâ)

```notes
lots of codebases have some form of tests, so let's use our new lens of the quote to see how good each of them are.

compilation tests, these are good examples of when they fail, it's a pretty big deal, code wouldn't even be deployable it has syntax errors so bad
it doesn't do so hot on the first part though, when they pass you're not exactly confident your code does what you want it to do. it's a bare minimum

linters, some of what these check are good user-facing problems, perhaps using a variable that doesn't exist or catching sneaky mistakes like variable shadowing or ===, but a lot of it is also just consistency, not exactly high signal user-facing issues

unit tests, are where we start to get more interesting. these might be running with mocha or jest and exercise a single component or small part of your site in isolation. they might ensure that a component passes the right props to the right children for example, which is helpful but just because they pass doesn't mean everything is going to work smoothly together

and that's where we get to integration tests, they have many names (integration, e2e, whatever you call it) but I'm talking about here is using the application in the way that is closest to how your end user is going to use it, for a website that means loading it in a real browser, and trying to use it!

# Puppeteer

```notes
Puppeteer is a javascript library built and maintained by the chrome team for making it easy to control *headless* Chrome.
```

---

`npm i -D puppeteer`

<Row>

<Column style={{width: '45vw'}}>
<img style={{marginRight: '2vw', width: '45vw', height: '60vh', objectFit: 'contain'}} src={require('file-loader!./puppeteer.png')} />
</Column>

<Column style={{width: '45vw'}}>

- Clean node API for launching a browser and controlling it
- Supports "headless" mode for running without a visible window
- Batteries included, i.e. automatically downloads a compatible copy of Chromium or Firefox


</Column>

</Row>


```notes
run through bullets...

### Screenshots

<div style={{maxWidth: '80vw', overflowX: 'scroll', textAlign: 'left'}}>

<Highlighter language="javascript">
{`const fs = require('fs');
const puppeteer = require('puppeteer');
const browser = await puppeteer.launch();
const page = await browser.newPage();
\n// Navigate and take the screenshot
await page.goto('https://www.theverge.com');
const screenshot = await page.screenshot();
fs.writeFileSync('theverge.png', screenshot);
\n// Cleanup when you're done
await browser.close();
`}
</Highlighter>


</div>

```notes
here we've got a quick example of how puppeteer works, no testing just getting a feel for the API

we'll try to grab a screenshot of The Verge news site

*walk through the code line by line*

You can also use it for more practical things though...

```

### Definitely Not A DMV Appointment

<div style={{maxWidth: '80vw', overflowX: 'scroll', textAlign: 'left'}}>

<Highlighter language="javascript">
{`const puppeteer = require('puppeteer');
const browser = await puppeteer.launch();
const page = await browser.newPage();
\n// Navigate through some forms
await page.goto('https://definitely-not-the-dmv.tx.gov');
await page.click('#btnEnglish');
await page.type('#KeypadTable', '555-555-5555');
await page.click('#btnHaveDLNo');
await page.click('#btnYesGetInline');
\n// Check for an appt and email PÃ∂aÃ∂tÃ∂rÃ∂iÃ∂cÃ∂kÃ∂ the hypothetical user
const hasAppointment = await page.evaluate(() => {
  return !document.body.textContent.includes('No service time available');
});
await sendEmailWithAvailability(hasAppointment, new Date());
`}
</Highlighter>

</div>

```notes
Like in this totally hypothetical example that definitely didn't happen to me of moving to TX and being confused about the DMV appoitments never being available

In this script we'll load up our browser, navigate to the definitely not the DMV URL,
```

### Automate Your Testing

<div style={{maxWidth: '80vw', overflowX: 'scroll', textAlign: 'left'}}>

<Highlighter language="javascript">
{`const puppeteer = require('puppeteer');
\nlet page;
beforeAll(async () => {
  const browser = await puppeteer.launch();
  page = await browser.newPage();
});
\nit('should login', async () => {
  await page.goto('http://localhost/login');
  await page.type('#username', 'mscott@dundermifflin.com');
  await page.type('#password', 'Thr3at Leve1 Midn1ght');
  await Promise.all([
    page.click('.login-btn'),
    page.waitForNavigation(),
  ]);
\n  // Check it looks good, requires 'jest-image-snapshot'
  expect(await page.screenshot()).toMatchImageSnapshot();
});`}
</Highlighter>

</div>

```notes
but now back to our main agenda with testing, let's walkthrough what it looks like on a real app testing the login flow

*walk through code*

think of how many layers of your site this is exercising, it's making sure API for login is working, the javascript to process input, the CSS is loading correctly, when this passes you have very high confidence things are working
```

---

### Use Familiar APIs

`dom-testing-library`

<div style={{maxWidth: '80vw', overflowX: 'scroll', textAlign: 'left'}}>

<Highlighter language="javascript">
{`require('pptr-testing-library/extend');
const puppeteer = require('puppeteer');
const browser = await puppeteer.launch();
const page = await browser.newPage();
\n// Load your app
await page.goto('http://localhost/login');
// Find your elements the way your user would
const $document = await page.getDocument();
const $emailInput = await $document.getByLabelText('Email');
const $passwordInput = await $document.getByLabelText('Password');
const $loginBtn = await $document.getByText('Login');
`}
</Highlighter>

</div>

```notes
You can also use APIs you might already be familiar with. If you've ever used dom-testing-library or react-testing-library there's a version for you specific to puppeteer

this is a collection of libraries inspired by that quote from the beginning of using the application *as your user would*
find the input by its label, not some class list or ID they don't care about

# Crash Course in Flakiness

```notes
Really quick before we close I want to give a crash course in avoiding flakiness, or tests that sometimes fail sometimes pass without code changes
```

---

### Preventing Flakiness


<Row>

<Column style={{width: '45vw', textAlign: 'left'}}>

## Bad

<Highlighter language="javascript">
{`await page.click('.add-to-cart')
// Page navigates to checkout view
await page.click('.checkout-btn')
// Page navigates to confirmation view
await page.click('.confirm-btn')`}
</Highlighter>

</Column>

<Column style={{width: '45vw', textAlign: 'left'}}>

## Better

<Highlighter language="javascript">
{`await page.click('.add-to-cart')
await page.waitFor('#checkout-view')
await page.click('.checkout-btn')
await page.waitFor('#confirmation-view')
await page.click('.confirm-btn')`}
</Highlighter>

</Column>
