# ⚡ Agenda

- Lighthouse, the tl;dr
- The CI Dilemma
- The Setup
- The Extras
- Q & A

```notes
Well here's our agenda for tonight...

...

Before we start though,

I was struggling to find a way to make a remote talk lively, if you've heard one of my past talks you know I like to poll the audience sometimes, and I don't think I could get through a talk without it, so we're gonna try that tonight.

```

<img src={require('file-loader!./winner.png')} style={{maxHeight: '30vh', display: 'block'}} />

<img src={require('file-loader!./testing-js.png')} style={{marginTop: '5vh', maxHeight: '55vh'}} />


```notes

AND on top of that, I will gift my license to Kent C Dodd's testing javascript course to one lucky participant tonight. Don't worry I didn't steal it or anything I maintain one of the testing libraries covered in it so I got one as a gift. I think it's the pro license which is pretty expensive too like $300 value so, pay attention to these polls!


Alright let's try one out, like with all great web things, it's gotta be overengineered, so I borrowed this from some friends on the Chrome Team who made "the Big Web Quiz" and I present to you
```

.... "The Big D Web Quiz"

So, get out your phones or on your laptop for the call go to this url: big-d-web-quiz.glitch.me

your super stumper big D web quiz question is: do you know what Lighthouse is?

Yes, this talk seems familiar.
Nope, but that's on you, Patrick.

# Lighthouse, the tl;dr

```notes
Lighthouse, what is it?
```

---


<img style={{maxWidth: '50vw', maxHeight: '50vh'}} src={require('file-loader!./lighthouse.svg')} />

lighthouse | \ˈlīt-ˌhau̇s (n):

a ~~tower or other structure~~ tool containing a beacon light to warn or guide ~~ships at sea~~ developers.

```notes
Lighthouse is a web auditing tool that helps you deliver a great web experience.

The web is a complicated place in 2020 with way, way too much for any one person to remember and keep track of in addition to your feature requirements. Lighthouse helps you offload that to focus on what's important and have an easy checklist when you're ready to make your site better.
```

---

<img style={{maxWidth: '90vw', maxHeight: '90vh'}} src={require('file-loader!./report.png')} />

```notes
It gives you a report like this, summary of the site's quality across the key categories with a score, and lets you drill down into the details in the rest of the report.

To give you an idea of the types of checks, everything from performance metrics, images that are too large and files that aren't minified to missing form labels, password inputs without paste and loading offline
```

## Continuous Integration

<blockquote style={{borderLeft: '3px solid #888', paddingLeft: 20}}>
<p style={{color: '#999', textAlign: 'left'}}>
a software development practice where members of a team <strong style={{color: '#333'}}>integrate their work frequently</strong>, usually each person integrates at least daily - leading to multiple integrations per day. Each <strong style={{color: '#333'}}>integration is verified by an automated build (including tests)</strong> to detect integration errors as quickly as possible.<br /><br />- Martin Fowler
</p>
</blockquote>


<img style={{marginLeft: '5vw', maxWidth: '70vw', maxHeight: '70vh'}} src={require('file-loader!./ci-providers.png')} />

```notes
For those of you not quite sure what I mean or aren't practicing yet, there are two main components to CI.

1. You integrate your changes to `master` branch / `trunk` / `dev` / whatever you call it, often.
2. A system (not you the developer) automatically tests those changes to revert or avoid landing if they break the build

the basic idea with CI is that when developers make small iterative changes, push code, and a system somewhere pulls down that version of the codebase and runs automated tests to determine whether it's safe before you deploy it to your users.

- Jenkins
- Travis
- TeamCity
- Circle
- GitLab
- GitHub Actions

are all common CI providers you might have heard of
```

---

## Common Automated Tests

- compilation (typescript/babel/webpack)
- linters (eslint/tslint)
- unit tests (mocha/jest)

## Less Common :(

- integration tests
- performance tests

```notes
Lots of codebases have some form of automated testing even, if you transpile your code with webpack or babel at the very least you're testing that there aren't crazy syntax errors for invalid javascript
linters are another common form of automated tests
unit tests are useful too to test individually isolated parts of your codebase

less common though are end to end or integration tests, it's almost a philosophical war what the differences but end-to-end, integration tests, acceptance tests, are tests that are much closer to how your ultimate users are going to use the code you write. if the code you write is a webapp, that'd be loading it in a *actual* browser and making sure it looks right, responds to the right clicks, broken images, etc.

and this is where lighthouse ci comes in
```

```notes
With Lighthouse CI, you'll get help running Lighthouse on every commit. That means it'll load your site in a real browser, run Lighthouse on it to get the same performance data, whether there are browser errors, images are sized correctly, all that good stuff from the report as part of your automated testing process.

get status checks right in GitHub for audit failures, and a fancy diffing UI for performance data on your very own Lighthouse CI server.

If you're eager and want to poke around the docs already, bit.ly/lhci takes you straight to the good stuff.

But let's jump into how to set it up.

#### .github/workflows/ci.yml

<div style={{textAlign: 'left', maxWidth: '90vw', overflowX: 'scroll'}}>
<Highlighter language="yaml">
{`name: CI
on: [push]
jobs:
  lighthouse:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v1
      - run: npm install && npm install -g @lhci/cli@0.3.x
      - run: npm run build
      - run: lhci autorun --upload.target=temporary-public-storage`}
</Highlighter>
</div>

```notes
You can throw LHCI onto one of your projects with just 11 lines even if you don't have any continuous integration process already setup. Github actions offers a free tier for 2000 minutes a month. Lighthouse CI works with just about any CI provider and there are example setup configs for half a dozen providers,

Let's look at what each of these lines do...

- First couple lines are actions boilerplate, we're going to run this action everytime someone pushes code and it's a job called lighthouse
- Run on Ubuntu
- Setup node
- Install project deps & lighthouse CI
- Builds our static site
- Runs lighthouse CI and uploads the results to a public URL that's accessible to everyone

So now we've got Lighthouse running on every commit and a link to the report in our build logs, but that's not what you came here for, we want those snazzy screenshots and our bot to keep it 100!

# The Extras

and that's what we'll look at next
```

## Assertions

**lighthouserc.js**:

<div style={{textAlign: 'left', maxWidth: '90vw', overflowX: 'scroll'}}>
<Highlighter language="js">
{`module.exports = {
  ci: {
    assert: {
      assertions: {
        "uses-responsive-images": ["error", {maxLength: 0}],
        "first-contentful-paint": ["error", {maxNumericValue: 2000}],
        "resource-summary:scripts:size": ["error", {maxNumericValue: 100e3}]
      }
    }
  }
}`}
</Highlighter>
</div>


```notes
So before we were getting a link to the Lighthouse report in our logs, but we have to open it up manually to take a look at what's going on. We're developers that's not gonna cut it! We want to automatically make sure we're passing the audits we care about.

That's where assertions come in. With assertions, Lighthouse CI will check the audits you care about and make sure your site is making the cut.

To get it setup just create a config file `lighthouserc.js` and throw this sucker in there. I know there's a lot of nesting because Lighthouse CI can do a lot of awesome things we're not going to cover in this talk, but let's focus on this assertions bit.

Any audit you see in the report can be asserted against. Each line here is one of the audits in the report.

- Uses responsive images is an audit checking to make sure that images aren't too big for their displayed size, so if you had a 20MP image being used as a thumbnail, this audit would catch it. Here we're asserting a maxLength of 0, so if anything comes up, we'll flag it.
- First contentful paint is an audit that measures how long it takes the page to render its first text of image. Here we're asserting a max value of 2000 milliseconds, so if it takes more than 2s to paint, we'll start failing.
- This last line is what you might be familiar with as a performance budget. It's looking at the total size of all scripts on the page and ensuring it's not more than 100KB. You might have seen in this in some of your tools like webpack, but has warnings for large JS sizes, but this is great because it looks at *ALL* the JS on your page even if its coming from a third-party.
```

## GitHub Status checks

#### https://github.com/apps/lighthouse-ci

<img style={{width: '80vw', height: '70vh', objectFit: 'contain'}} src={require('file-loader!./github-app.png')} />

```notes
That's some great progress, but cmon Patrick you're making me look at some ugly build logs to find out what failed, that's lame! I don't know about you, but I want that nice green checkmark from Lighthouse telling me I did a good job.

we want more, so let's get Github involved! and that's where the app comes in. Open up the Lighthouse CI github app by going to that URL or clicking the link in the getting started section of Lighthouse CI docs, and add it to you repos. It's going to give you a LHCI_GITHUB_APP_TOKEN that you put in your CI provider's environment variables (which we've got docs for) and BOOM you've got these nice little checkmarks on your PRs.

The other nice thing about the github app is that the "Details" links straight to the report so you're able to jump to a Lighthouse report of every PR even if you're passing your assertions too.
```

```notes
Last but finally not least in the extras is the Lighthouse CI server.

So far everything has been happening in the CI provider and on the temporary public storage service. But maybe you want to save reports for longer than a week, maybe you want some nice graphs of how your performance has improved over time to show your boss.

That's where the CI server comes in. The server is an open source project you can setup on AWS/GCP/heroku/anywhere you like to have your very own storage and visualization center for your Lighthouse reports. This screenshot on the left is the dashboard. It covers high level trends, graphs your category scores over time, and highlights deltas so you can see exactly which commit started regressing performance or accessibility.

This screenshot on the right is my personal favorite. The build comparison view. For any two Lighthouse versions of your repo you can compare the Lighthouse reports and drill down into differences. I love this view, because there are lots of tools that graph stuff over time but visualizing what exactly changed on your site has been really difficult. This makes it super easy to see what resources were different which metrics changed, audits, etc.

```notes
Aaaaaaand the best part is it's super easy to get started. You don't have to read this or make sense of it or anything, it's just here to prove to you you can setup an LHCI server for free with only one slide of code.

This sets up the LHCI server on heroku which is a PaaS provider with a free tier, so just create a git repo, copy some files from our examples, push it up to heroku and you've got yourself your very own LHCI server!

1-slide proof, don't say it couldn't be done :)
